# EduBlock – README for Hackathon Submission

## Project Name

**EduBlock** – A gamified, AI-powered learning system with blockchain-based achievements

## About the Project

EduBlock is a futuristic EdTech solution that transforms the traditional online learning experience into an engaging, supportive, and decentralized ecosystem. Designed for the modern learner, EduBlock introduces:

* AI-generated quizzes for continuous engagement
* Token-based rewards for correct answers
* NFT badges as verifiable, ownable credentials

We’re rethinking how learning is structured, rewarded, and proven in the AI era — focusing on consistency, clarity, and motivation.



## Problem Statement

Online learners are stuck in endless video courses, lacking structure, support, and credible recognition of their progress. Dropout rates are high due to lack of motivation and absence of real, emotional feedback or progress validation.



## Our Solution

EduBlock introduces:

* **Short, gamified learning tasks (sprints)**
* **AI-generated quiz questions** personalized to the learner's sprint topic
* **Blockchain tokens** rewarded for correct answers
* **NFT badges** minted when learners complete modules with good scores

This creates a motivating loop — where every step forward feels earned, tracked, and owned.
